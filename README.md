### Project Dependency Graph ###
![](image link)
- App module depend on (core + feature games list screen + feature game detail screen) : contains app start point it may be a splash screen.
- Core module depend on nothing  : contains all sharable data among different modules.
- Feature Games List Screen Module depend on core : contain games list screen feature related ui and other staffs.
- Feature Game Detail Screen Module depend on core : contain game detail screen feature related ui.

### Use domain specific language ###
- Make gradle scripts easy
- Support Kotlin for better dependencies management by Using Domain-Specific Languages.
- Support autocomplete

### Use Detect ###
- to make code style analysis and be sure follow best practice for writing kotlin code.

### Proguard To avoid 64k functions problem and get smaller apk ###
- Enables code shrinking, obfuscation, and optimization for only
- Enables resource shrinking, which is performed by the

### Modular architecture ###
- Speeds up builds
- Enable on demand delivery
- Simplify development
- Reuse modules across apps
- Experiment with new technologies
- Scale development teams
- Enables refactoring
- Simplifies test automation

### Clean architecture ###
- its a good choice to make project scalable and easy to test small parts  

### MVVM Inside each module 
- each developer inside android team has a free to select suitable architecture for his module. 

### Dependency injection with Hilt ###
- Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in our project.

### Moshi ###
- Moshi is a modern JSON library for Android, Java and Kotlin. It makes it easy to parse JSON into Java and Kotlin classes

### Load and display paged data ###
- The Paging3 library provides powerful capabilities for loading and displaying paged data from a larger dataset.

### Enable AppCenter Pipelines ###
- Support CI so i can check different stages like build and run unit test 
before merge any branch to master branch.

### Firebase crashlytics ###
- to rack bugs even though app moved to production

### Data binding
- The Data Binding Library automatically generates the classes required to bind the views in the layout with your data objects.

### leakCanary 
- to detect memory leak through debugging process that will improve app performance as well. 

### Truth For unit test its recommended from google
- write unit test for [Search Validator Class](https://github.com/MostafaAnter/totersapp/blob/master/feature_characters_list/src/test/java/app/anter/feature_characters_list/SearchValidatorTest.kt)
- write integrated test for ensure [Database work fine](https://github.com/MostafaAnter/totersapp/blob/master/core_data/src/androidTest/java/app/anter/core_data/AppDatabaseTest.kt)

### Reactive programming (Coroutines)
Coroutines is Google recommended solution for asynchronous programming on Android. Noteworthy features include the following:

- Lightweight: You can run many coroutines on a single thread due to support for suspension, which doesn't block the thread where the coroutine is running. Suspending saves memory over blocking while supporting many concurrent operations.
- Fewer memory leaks: Use structured concurrency to run operations within a scope.
- Built-in cancellation support: Cancellation is propagated automatically through the running coroutine hierarchy.
- Jetpack integration: Many Jetpack libraries include extensions that provide full coroutines support. Some libraries also provide their own coroutine scope that you can use for structured concurrency.

### Local database using Room ###
- Compile-time verification of SQL queries.
- Convenience annotations that minimize repetitive and error-prone boilerplate code.
- Streamlined database migration paths.

### Paging 3 ###
- In-memory caching for your paged data. This ensures that your app uses system resources efficiently while working with paged data.
- Built-in request deduplication, ensuring that your app uses network bandwidth and system resources efficiently.
- Configurable RecyclerView adapters that automatically request data as the user scrolls toward the end of the loaded data.
- First-class support for Kotlin coroutines and Flow, as well as LiveData and RxJava.
- Built-in support for error handling, including refresh and retry capabilities.
